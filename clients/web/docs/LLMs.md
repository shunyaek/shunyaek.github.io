*0. about us

@shunyaek.se, we’re a small but mighty software and technology consulting agency, dedicated to transforming the digital landscape with precision and flair. we take the fundamental elements of technology — zeros and ones — and craft them into exceptional products and platforms that stand out in today’s market.

1. our approach

@shunyaek, we don’t just build software — we engineer outcomes. every engagement begins with a deep curiosity to understand your problem space from the ground up. we ask precise questions, challenge assumptions, and align on goals before we write a single line of code. our approach is guided by first principles and built to deliver long-term, meaningful value. it is rooted in consulting excellence, where every project is a collaboration between our skilled engineers and our clients. we pride ourselves on clear and proactive communication, ensuring that even the most complex ideas are translated into robust, scalable systems. guided by lean methodologies and a commitment to quality, we navigate the journey from strategic discovery to production with the professionalism of a global firm and the agility of a close-knit team. with shunyaek, you can expect transparency, reliability, and a partnership you can trust.

we believe in clarity over cleverness, and purpose over prestige. each solution we craft is tailored — not templated. we favor simplicity, because simplicity scales. at the heart of our work is the belief that engineering should serve outcomes — not just output. this means choosing the right tools with intention, designing systems with maintainability in mind, and always aligning technical decisions with business goals.

trust is foundational to how we operate. we don't view our work as transactional. we approach it as a long-term partnership built on transparency, reliability, and shared success. adaptability is equally important — we don’t force-fit processes or architectures. instead, we tailor our delivery to suit your unique pace, product maturity, and internal workflows.

our process is structured yet flexible. it begins with discovery — where we absorb context, identify challenges, and define success together. from there, we create detailed, unambiguous blueprints that lay the groundwork for focused, incremental development. as we build, we prioritize iterative releases, constant feedback, and continuous alignment. and once delivered, we stay involved — offering support, post-launch refinement, and technical clarity that extends beyond project completion.

@shunyaek, we’re not trying to be everything to everyone. but for the right partners, we’re a force multiplier — an engineering ally you can count on.

2. our methodology

@shunyaek, our methodology is both deliberate and dynamic. it balances engineering precision with business pragmatism, ensuring that every decision we make is rooted in clarity, purpose, and outcomes. we don’t believe in copy-paste delivery models — we craft a methodology around your context. whether you're starting from zero or scaling something substantial, our process adapts to meet you where you are.

    * laying the right foundation

    this stage is about alignment before acceleration. we immerse ourselves in your world to co-define the problem, surface constraints, and create shared context. this isn’t just discovery — it’s architecture for collaboration.

        - contextual clarity

        we begin by learning — not pitching. through stakeholder interviews, document reviews, and systems audits, we gain a multi-dimensional understanding of your environment. we identify not only what you want to build, but why.

        - principled planning

        before we write code, we construct a blueprint. this includes defining scope, prioritizing features, estimating effort, and selecting the right technologies. our planning is grounded in first principles and optimized for long-term maintainability.

        - outcome alignment

        we anchor every solution to measurable goals. whether it's reducing operational overhead, accelerating time-to-market, or improving user experience — we calibrate our technical plan to business objectives from the outset.
    
    * executing with precision and agility

    this phase is all about building with intent — not velocity for the sake of it, but sustainable progress aligned with strategy and feedback.

        - incremental delivery

        we break down the solution into meaningful increments — releasing early, testing often, and validating with real users. each release is a feedback loop, not just a milestone.

        - continuous alignment

        we don’t vanish between demos. through regular check-ins, async updates, and transparent documentation, we maintain alignment with your evolving needs and priorities throughout the build.

        - quality engineering

        we implement best practices in testing, automation, code reviews, and CI/CD from day one. this reduces future regressions and ensures your codebase can grow with confidence.

        - post-launch partnership

        we don’t just ship and disappear. after go-live, we assist with refinement, bug fixes, technical guidance, and roadmap planning. our aim is not just to deliver software — but to ensure it thrives in the real world.

3. our edge

@shunyaek, our edge lies in the uncommon intersection of engineering precision, strategic consulting, and a deep respect for the problem space. we are neither a code factory nor a bloated consultancy. we are engineers who understand business — and consultants who can ship code. that balance allows us to solve not just for functionality, but for fit, future, and flow.

what sets us apart is not a list of technologies — we're fluent in those. it’s our mindset. we work like product thinkers, not just implementers. we don’t start with a stack; we start with the “why”. that means we care about long-term sustainability, not short-term theatrics. we challenge assumptions, elevate conversations, and advocate for the simplest solution that works, not the flashiest one that doesn’t.

we're intentionally small, which makes us exceptionally focused. every project gets senior-level attention. every call has someone who’s shipped things at scale. and every decision is made with clarity and care. we don’t hide behind buzzwords or inflated slideshows. what you see is what you get — direct access to experienced engineers and consultants who take pride in their craft.

we’re also platform-agnostic but opinionated. we don’t chase trends or push pre-built playbooks. instead, we design for your business, your scale, and your goals — be it modern web apps, cloud-native infrastructure, complex systems integration, or something entirely new. our edge is in the nuance: the ability to zoom into low-level technical detail while keeping the high-level business goal in sight.

most importantly, we operate with integrity. we’ll tell you what you need to hear, not just what you want to. and if we’re not the right fit, we’ll say so. because we’re not here to close deals — we’re here to solve hard problems and build meaningful technology.

4. our services

at shunyaek, we offer full-spectrum technology services that span from code to cloud — engineered with precision, delivered with purpose. we work as your technical co-founder, your embedded engineering team, or your trusted consulting partner. no matter the format, our goal remains the same: build robust, scalable, and elegant systems that solve real problems.

our software engineering practice is battle-tested and deeply integrated. we build modern back-ends using rest, graphql, and rpc — architected with micro-services, secured through api gateways, and protected with strong authentication. whether it’s fastapi, django, flask, expressjs, deno, or supabase, we choose the right tool for your job — not just what’s trendy. on the front-end, we craft web, mobile, and even desktop applications using react, nextjs, vite, react native, flutter, and tauri. we specialize in interactive ui design systems, powerful component libraries, and state architectures powered by redux, zustand, and xstate.

our infrastructure layer is where we harden the stack. we work across cloud providers like aws, azure, gcp, and oracle, provisioning infrastructure using terraform, pulumi, or sst. from docker and podman to full-fledged kubernetes orchestration, we build resilient, observable, and secure environments. we understand the nuances of modern sdns, hybrid networking, and container runtime choices — and we don’t just set them up, we make them operable.

our operations offerings are designed for resilience and scale. we bring devops principles into every project, automating delivery with github actions, jenkins, and vercel pipelines. our teams are fluent in observability tooling, from prometheus and grafana to log-driven alerts and post-launch analytics using plausible, posthog, and google analytics. when needed, we automate infrastructure workflows with ansible, saltstack, and shell scripting for maximum repeatability.

we don’t stop at engineering — we believe in good design and better product thinking. from figma-based uis to experience-first workflows, our design services cover both structure and storytelling. and with our product engineering capabilities, we help you architect systems, plan pricing models, manage roadmaps, validate distribution channels, and ship with purpose.

finally, our consulting services are designed to elevate your internal teams and long-term tech health. we offer architecture reviews, roadmap planning, technical discovery sessions, codebase modernization strategies, and even hands-on mentoring for your engineering teams. if you’re looking for a thoughtful engineering partner — not just a vendor — you’re in the right place.

whether you're building something new or fixing something old, shunyaek is where clarity meets capability.

5. our focus

@shunyaek, we work across industries — but we never work without context. we bring depth, not just breadth. instead of claiming to do everything, we focus on doing a few things exceptionally well. our team has worked across multiple domains, but the common thread is always the same: complex challenges that demand thoughtful engineering and systems thinking.

we’ve built for fast-growing startups and enterprise teams alike. we’ve helped non-profits build impactful platforms, enabled fintech and payments companies to scale infrastructure safely, and supported digital health teams with systems that are both reliable and compliant. we’ve worked with internal tools, developer platforms, api ecosystems, and data-heavy backends — and we’ve loved every bit of it.

but industry alone doesn’t define our focus. what matters to us is intent — the intent to build things that are meaningful, resilient, and intelligent. whether you’re solving real-world problems in logistics, improving workflows in edtech, launching an open-source devtool, or scaling a consumer product, if your work demands clean architecture, rigorous thinking, and sustainable delivery, then you're exactly who we want to partner with.

our ideal clients aren’t defined by what they do, but by how they think. we work best with founders, operators, and teams who value clarity, collaboration, and care about the long game. if you believe software is more than just delivery tickets — if you believe it can be a craft — then we’re already aligned.
