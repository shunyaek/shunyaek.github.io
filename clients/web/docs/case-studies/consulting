### ✨ Case-Study — Data & Technology Consulting Enablement (Concise)

---

#### 1. Project Snapshot

* **Domain**: Technology, Software & Data Consulting
* **Engagement**: Full-stack platform engineering, data-pipeline accelerators, AI enablement
* **Timeline**: Oct 2021 – Jan 2023 (16 mos)
* **Tech Highlights**: Python · FastAPI · Airflow · Docker · Kubernetes · Snowflake · AWS · React · TypeScript · Tableau

---

#### 2. Challenge

Consulting teams across industries (retail, manufacturing, financial services) needed to stand up secure, client-side data and AI environments **within days, not weeks**. Rebuilding ingestion scripts, model-serving APIs, and dashboards for every engagement burned precious billable hours and led to inconsistent compliance outcomes.

---

#### 3. Goals & Success Metrics

* **Primary objective**: Provide ready-to-use, production-grade technology and data foundations **3× faster** than previous bespoke builds.
* **KPIs**

  * Reduce “time-to-first-insight” from \~30 days to ≤10 days
  * Achieve ≥80 % reuse of accelerator modules across client projects
  * Ensure 100 % first-pass success in internal security reviews

#### 4. Our Role

| Role                       | Scope (examples)                    | % Effort |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- |
| Platform Engineer (lead)   | Cloud templates, CI/CD workflows    | 50 %     |
| Data Integration Developer | Ingestion connectors, API gateways  | 30 %     |
| Front-end Contributor      | React dashboards, Tableau embedding | 20 %     |

---

#### 5. Approach & Process

* Authored **cloud-agnostic infrastructure modules** (Terraform + helm) for AWS, Azure, and on-prem Kubernetes.
* Packaged **Airflow DAG blueprints** covering ingest → transform → serve, with YAML configuration.
* Exposed common services (feature store, model registry, metrics) through **FastAPI micro-service layer**.
* Shipped a **React “project-wizard”** and CLI that scaffolded repos, infra scripts, and sample notebooks in minutes.
* Wired pipelines to **Snowflake** or client-preferred warehouses with column-level encryption policies.
* Embedded **policy scans** (OPA, Checkov) and container security checks in GitHub Actions.

---

#### 6. Solution Highlights

* **Accelerator Library** — modular ingestion, training, and visualisation components ready for drop-in use.
* **One-Click Deployment** — helm charts & Terraform spin up full stack in any client VPC.
* **Security-as-Code Gates** — merge blocked unless CIS, GDPR, and firm-wide controls pass.
* **Self-Service Dashboards** — Tableau or React visuals connect via signed URLs—no hard-coded creds.

#### 7. Impact

| Metric                               | Before   | After    | Δ          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Time-to-first-insight (days)         | 30       | **10**   | −67 %      |
| Module reuse across engagements      | 40 %     | **85 %** | +45 p.p.   |
| Security re-submission rate          | 4 / proj | **0**    | Eliminated |
| Average non-billable ramp-up (weeks) | 4        | **1**    | −75 %      |

---

#### 8. Key Learnings

* Reusable blueprints out-perform “best-practice” PDFs—consultants adopt what they can execute.
* Embedding compliance in pipelines eliminates last-minute surprises.
* A dual **wizard UI + CLI** approach serves both no-code and power-user personas.

---

#### 9. Visual Glimpse *(optional)*

> *Project Wizard → GitHub Actions → Helm/Terraform Deploy → Airflow & FastAPI Services → Dashboards*

---

#### 10. What’s Next?

* Add real-time streaming (Kafka) for clients with high-velocity IoT data.
* Publish selected accelerator modules as open source to widen adoption.
